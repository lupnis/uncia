# Unified Node for Computational Intelligence and Analytics (UNCIA) 

**🚧 Work in Progress 🚧**

This repository is the starting point for the Unified Node for Computational Intelligence and Analytics (UNCIA) project.

The vision behind UNCIA is to explore and define a supercomputing architecture that can integrate computational intelligence with large-scale analytics. At this stage, the project is primarily focused on conceptual design, planning, and organization.

## Current Status 🛠️

The project is still under early development.

Many details, including core architecture, hardware/software configurations, and system-level optimizations, are still being refined.

Documentation will evolve gradually as ideas take shape and implementation paths become clearer.

## Goals 🎯

Provide a foundational framework for scalable and unified computational intelligence.

Explore system design principles for efficient data processing and analytics at scale.

Experiment with integration strategies across hardware and software layers.

## Notes 📌

This is not yet a complete implementation, but rather an open exploration and planning effort.

Community feedback, suggestions, and collaboration are highly welcome.

Expect frequent revisions as the architecture and supporting components mature.
